# Colors in Culture
## A Gradient Generator

Based off an infographic I found several years back on informationisbeautiful.net
The Colors in Culture Gradient Generator generates a gradient based off cultural values and their corresponding color.

#### example
The page default page view shows that in Western/American culture(s), a gradient of earthy & nature values would represent a brown/green gradient.

#### to-do
Add the rest of the cultures so it's not so ethnocentric.
There's no easy to way to automate it, and the infographic consists of 9 or so cultures which ~80 values each (so it's not something I look forward to doing).
